Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an ` O' or an ` X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player to get three of the same symbols in a row.

I create a super fun game, called Tic Tac Toe. This game is even called Xs and Os. To build this project I used HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript. No images, libraries or icons are needed.
